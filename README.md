## Language with Boost Spirit X3
Tiny language to test Spirit x3. Not a complete language, lacks proper error handling, etc. Spirit x3 is okay if you don't want to write a compiler from scratch. But I didn't find the documentation great and it's hard to search for answers as it seems not many people use x3. That being said it was very fast to write even considering I was learning the library while writing this program. I wrote this in a single day without any previous knowledge of Spirit so despite some annoyances it is still a very fast way to get a compiler written without a ton of effort. 

Print 15, then "Hello World"
```python
a = 10
b = 5
print_num(a + b)
print_char(72)
print_char(101)
print_char(108)
print_char(108)
print_char(111)
print_char(10)
```
